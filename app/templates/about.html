    <h2>About AndroidSnippets.com</h2>
    
    <div style="margin:10px 2px; width:500px;">
        <p>AndroidSnippets is a community driven website for finding, exploring, sharing and improving
        source code snippets for Android. 
        </p>

        <p><h3>Improving Snippets</h3></p>
        <p>Every user can edit snippets (by clicking on the "edit" button on the right side), and submit improvements 
        for the community to review. Edits are visible on the snippet's page and can be upvoted and downvoted
        by registered users. Once an edit reaches a sum of +5, it is used as the default version. For every
        future upvote on the snippet, every author of an 'merged' edit as well as the original author gain one reputation point. 
        </p>
        <p><h3>Reputation Points</h3></p>
        <p>Reputation points are a rough indicator
        of a user's contributions to the snippet collection. They can be gained by:
        </p>
        <p><ol>
            <li>submitting a snippet: <b>+1</b></li>
            <li>every upvote on your snippet: <b>+1</b></li>
            <li>every upvote on your edit of a snippet: <b>+3</b></li>
            <li>every downvote on your edit of a snippet: <b>-1</b></li>
        </ol>
        <p></p>
        </p>

        <p><h3>Licenses</h3></p>

        of service</a>, which allow everyone to reuse and modify the snippet without any 
        current or future restrictions.</p>
